# TilakKumar05-SQL-Advanced-Case-Study---Transaction-Insights-and-Regional-Trends

1. **Project Overview**
**Title: SQL Advanced Case Study**
**Description:** This repository contains an advanced SQL case study focusing on business analytics, involving data extraction, transformation, and insights generation. The case study utilizes normalized database schemas to answer key business questions.

  **Database Tables:**
- DIM_CUSTOMER: Stores customer details.
- DIM_DATE: Includes transactional date-related information.
- DIM_LOCATION: Contains location-based data like state and zip codes.
- DIM_MANUFACTURER: Holds manufacturer information for products.
- DIM_MODEL: Stores product model details.
- FACT_TRANSACTIONS: Records transactional data including sales, returns, and quantities.
  
2. **Key Insights and Queries**
- This repository demonstrates advanced SQL querying techniques to solve business problems:

**State-wise Sales Analysis:**
- Identified states with transactions after 2005.
**Top Performing States for a Specific Manufacturer:**
- Analyzed transaction data for "Samsung" in the US to determine the state with maximum product sales.
**Transaction Density by Location:**
- Examined zip codes with the highest number of customer transactions for specific product models.
**Revenue Analysis:**
- Combined revenue generation analysis across different categories like "Electronics" and "Clothing".
**Return Patterns:**
- Insights into product categories with the highest returns over specified periods.
**Customer Segmentation:**
- Segregated customers based on age groups, transaction frequency, and categories of interest.
**Top-Selling Sub-Categories:**
- Identified sub-categories with the maximum sales and their respective percentages of returns.
  
 3. **Analytical Goals**
- Uncover hidden trends in sales and returns.
- Generate actionable insights for decision-making in inventory, marketing, and customer engagement.
- Demonstrate expertise in joining normalized tables, filtering data with advanced conditions, and aggregating metrics for business performance.
  
4. **Technology Stack**
- SQL Server: Query execution and database management.
- Database Design: Normalized schemas for efficient querying.

5. **Usage**
- Import the SQL file into your preferred SQL Server.
- Run the queries sequentially to analyze various aspects of the dataset.
- Modify the parameters (e.g., manufacturer, date range) as per business requirements.

6. **Learning Outcomes**
Mastery in SQL querying techniques like joins, subqueries, aggregations, and filtering.
Deep understanding of relational database design and schema relationships.
Ability to generate business insights from transactional data.

7. **Future Scope**
Automate queries using stored procedures.
Visualize the results with a BI tool like Tableau or Power BI.
Extend the case study with predictive modeling for sales forecasting.
